# Node Typescript Template

Starter template for `NodeJS 14+` projects with `TypeScript 4.2+`, `Jest` and `ES modules`.

"Usual suspects" of tooling:

* eslint
* prettier
* npm scripts for common tasks of building, testing and linting.
* [volta](https://volta.sh) for reproducible environments. If you haven't tried it, I strongly recommend you do :thumbsup:.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or click _Use this template_ button on Github.
2. Add your name to _package.json_ `author` field and `LICENSE` file.
3. Add code to `src` and tests to `__tests__` directory.
4. Enjoy :man_dancing::dancer:.
